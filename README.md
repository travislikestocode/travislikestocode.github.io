So far the only thing here is my little pokemon guessing game which can be played [here](https://travislikestocode.github.io/whodatpokemon_states/public/index.html). I'm aware of the bug with Mr. Mime. He's the only pokemon with a space in his name. Code is [here](./whodatpokemon_states/public/). Most of the game logic is in play.js. I made this a long time ago so please see my more recent repos if you want to judge my coding skill!

I can't remember where I got the assets but I most definitely do not own them. I will comply with any copyright takedowns :)
